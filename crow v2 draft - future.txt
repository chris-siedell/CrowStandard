Idea: 4095 byte payloads
------------------------
The reserved bit is there. Necessary? What are downsides?


Idea: numbered intermediate responses
-------------------------------------
Ensures data integrity when multiple responses used.
Perhaps optional (an indefinite vs definite option).
Would break current packet format.
Rebuttal: intermediate responses should be used just to keep transaction open, not
 primarily to stream data.


Idea: intermediate command packets
----------------------------------
Would allow streaming to device.
Too much burden on low-resource devices?
If numbered, would break packet format.


Idea: CRC option
----------------
CRC would be optional for devices, only Fletcher16 would be required.
What would header format be? (A v1-2 header wrapped with an additional CRC?)


Idea: alarm flag
----------------
to compensate for lack of device->host initiated comms
each port has 7-bit alarm level (0 = clear, 1-127 = set)
user or admin code on device can set or clear the alarm level at any time
a set alarm would cause an alarm flag in responses to be raise, regardless of what the response is to
host can then use admin command to queury what alarms are set (3 bytes per alarm: 2 for port, 7 bits for level, 1 bit for port type)
host can clear alarms individually or en masse

Idea: alarm byte
----------------
If using two lines, only one device, and a full duplex host then sending an
alarm byte will never be a problem. Otherwise, sending a single byte when
there's no open transaction may or may not be a problem. If the host can detect when
mangling has taken place and then terminate and resend, this could be a
recoverable error. The purpose of the alarm byte would be to tell the host
that there is an alarm condition. Possible format
                |7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
          ------|---------------|
          Alarm |1|1|x|  addr   |
Bit 7 is the same as a normal device response, bit 6 is different
(distinguishing it from a normal device response. Bits 0-4 give the
address of the device raising the alarm. Bit x could make this multipurpose:
x=1 this is an alarm notice and the host should queury to get the alarm flag,
and x=0 signifies that the host is going offline.
