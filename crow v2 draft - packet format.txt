The Command Header
==================

A command header is always 7 bytes and has the following format:

               |7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
         ------|---------------|
          CH0  |0|0|  Su |0|0|1|
          CH1  |      Sl       |
          CH2  |R|0|0|    A    |
          CH3  |       P       |
          CH4  |       K       |
          CH5  |      C0       |
          CH6  |      C1       |

The fields have the following definitions:

    S = Su << 8 | Sl = payloadSize (0-2047 bytes, exclusive of error detection bytes)
    A = address (0-31)
    R = responseExpected: 1 - response expected/required,
                          0 - responses forbidden (must be set if address = 0)
    P = port
    K = token, a byte that the device must send with the response to this command
    C0, C1 = check bytes that cause the running Fletcher 16 checksum to evaluate to zero if initialized to zero before CH0.

The other bits are reserved. A v2 device must silently ignore any command that does not have
the reserved bits as shown.


The Response Header
===================

A response header is always 5 bytes and has the following format:

                |7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
          ------|---------------|
           RH0  |E|0|  Su |0|1|0|
           RH1  |      Sl       |
           RH2  |       K       |
           RH3  |      Fu       |
           RH4  |      Fl       |

The fields have the following definitions:

    S = Su << 8 | Sl = payload size (0-2047 bytes, exclusive of error detection bytes)
    E = errorFlag: 0 - normal response, 1 - crow-level error response
    K = token, the same value that was sent with the command
    Fu, Fl - The Fletcher 16 checksum after being initialized to zero and processing bytes RH0-RH2. Fu is the upper sum, and Fl is the lower sum.

The other bits are reserved and must have the values shown.



Changes from V1
===============

- The bits within CH0 and RH0 have been rearranged.
- The bytes in the command header have been rearranged.
- 'Protocol numbers' are now 'ports'.
- The number of ports has been reduced (two-byte to one-byte values).
- The implicit port option has been removed.
- The user/admin command distinction has been removed.
- The 'mute' field has been changed to 'responseExpected' with the values
  inverted.
- Intermediate responses have been removed.
